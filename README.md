# Two_Table_Using_-CUSTOMERS_and_ORDERS_in_JOINS
This project demonstrates SQL JOIN operations using CUSTOMERS and ORDERS tables.  
It includes INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and a simulated FULL JOIN using UNION.  
MySQL doesn't support FULL JOIN natively, so a workaround is used.  
Useful for learning and practicing SQL joins in real-world scenarios.
